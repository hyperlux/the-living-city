# APPENDIX E: THE TRANSPORT SYSTEMS

## Technical Specifications for Circulation in the Living City

---

## E.1 Design Principles

### The Mobility Hierarchy

All transport planning follows this priority order:

1. **Eliminate**: Remove the need to travel (proximity, remote work)
2. **Walk**: Design for pedestrian movement
3. **Cycle**: Enable active transport
4. **Share**: Provide shared vehicles and transit
5. **Electrify**: All remaining vehicles are electric
6. **Automate**: Remove human driving errors and inefficiencies

### The 15-Minute Neighborhood

**Core principle**: All daily needs accessible within 15 minutes on foot

**Density requirements**:
- Minimum: 100 dwellings/hectare
- Target: 150-200 dwellings/hectare
- Maximum: 300 dwellings/hectare (preserving human scale)

**Service distribution**:
| Service | Maximum Distance | Walk Time |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Grocery/daily retail | 400 m | 5 min |
| Primary school | 500 m | 6 min |
| Healthcare (primary) | 800 m | 10 min |
| Parks/green space | 300 m | 4 min |
| Transit stop | 400 m | 5 min |
| Employment (mixed-use) | 1,000 m | 12 min |
