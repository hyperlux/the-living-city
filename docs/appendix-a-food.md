# APPENDIX A: THE FOOD SYSTEMS

## Technical Specifications for Nourishment in the Living City

---

## A.1 Production Targets

### Primary Goals

| Category | Target | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Leafy Greens | 90% local | Vertical farms, rooftops |
| Herbs & Microgreens | 95% local | Building-integrated, windowsills |
| Fruiting Vegetables | 60% local | Greenhouse and rooftop |
| Root Vegetables | 40% local | Underground, basement, mushroom farms |
| Fruits | 30% local | Orchards, espaliers, rooftops |
| Grains | 10% local | Primarily regional |
| Protein (plant) | 50% local | Mushrooms, legumes, algae |
| Protein (animal) | 20% local | Aquaponics, insects |

### Caloric Targets

The Living City aims for 25% of total caloric needs from local production. This may seem low, but calories are not the bottleneck—nutrition is. We prioritize:

- Fresh vegetables and fruits (highest nutritional density, fastest spoilage, greatest transport impact)
- Specialty products (herbs, microgreens, mushrooms)
- Protein supplements (insect meal, algae, aquaponic fish)

Bulk calories (grains, oils, staple proteins) continue to come from regional and global agricultural systems, but with transformed supply chains: shorter, more transparent, more resilient.
