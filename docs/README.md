# THE LIVING CITY

**A Manifesto for the Urban Future**

---

Every smart city pitch you've ever seen is a lie dressed in sensor networks.

What we're building is something else entirely. A living system. Not a city that *uses* technology, but a city that *is* technology and biology and human aspiration woven into a single, breathing organism.
