# APPENDIX F: THE STRUCTURE SYSTEMS

## Technical Specifications for Living Buildings in the Living City

---

## F.1 Design Philosophy

### Buildings as Organisms

In the Living City, buildings are not inert containers. They are active participants in urban metabolism—generating, transforming, adapting, healing. This shift from construction to cultivation represents the most fundamental change in how we conceive of shelter.

**The biological paradigm**:
- Buildings grow rather than being assembled
- Materials self-heal rather than degrading
- Structures adapt rather than remaining fixed
- At end of life, buildings compost rather than demolish

**Key thinker: Michael Levin** (Tufts University) has demonstrated that bioelectrical signals coordinate large-scale anatomical decisions in living organisms. His work on pattern memory and morphogenesis informs our approach to buildings that know their own shape and can restore it after damage. A building, like a body, maintains its form through active processes, not passive stability.

**Key thinker: Neri Oxman** (MIT Media Lab) pioneered Material Ecology—the study and design of built objects that grow rather than are assembled. Her work demonstrates that computation, biology, and fabrication can merge to create structures impossible through traditional construction.

## F.2 Living Materials

### Mycelium Composites

Mycelium—the root structure of fungi—forms the basis of many Living City building materials:

**Properties**:
| Property | Mycelium Composite | Conventional Equivalent |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Density | 60-300 kg/m³ | EPS foam: 25-200 kg/m³ |
| Compressive strength | 0.17-1.1 MPa | Foam: 0.07-0.42 MPa |
| Thermal conductivity | 0.04-0.08 W/mK | Foam: 0.03-0.04 W/mK |
| Fire resistance | Self-extinguishing | Often flammable |
| Carbon footprint | Net negative | Highly positive |

**Current projects and research**:
- **Ecovative Design** (New York): Commercial production of mycelium packaging and insulation panels. Their Forager Hive process grows materials in days rather than extracting them over centuries.
- **MOGU** (Italy): Acoustic panels and flooring from mycelium. Demonstrated fire resistance exceeding conventional materials.
- **The Living** (Hy-Fi tower, MoMA PS1, 2014): First large-scale structure from mycelium bricks. 13 meters tall, fully compostable.
- **NASA research**: Investigating mycelium habitats for Mars—structures that grow from dormant fungi activated with water.

**Living City applications**:
- Insulation panels (grown in situ within wall cavities)
- Acoustic treatments
- Temporary structures (festivals, emergency shelter)
- Interior partitions
- Packaging for construction materials

### Self-Healing Concrete

The Living City uses concrete that repairs its own cracks:

**Bacterial self-healing** (developed at TU Delft by Hendrik Jonkers):
- Dormant bacteria (Bacillus species) embedded in concrete matrix
- When cracks form, water enters and activates bacteria
- Bacteria precipitate calcium carbonate, sealing cracks
- Effective for cracks up to 0.8mm wide
- Extends structural lifespan by 50-100%

**Quantitative data**:
| Metric | Self-Healing Concrete | Conventional Concrete |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Crack repair rate | 0.2mm/week | N/A (requires intervention) |
| Maintenance cost reduction | 50-70% | Baseline |
| Lifespan extension | 50-100% | 50 years typical |
| Carbon footprint | 30% reduction (less repair cycles) | Baseline |

**Additional self-healing approaches**:
- **Microcapsules**: Healing agents released when cracks break capsules (University of Illinois)
- **Shape memory polymers**: Tendons that contract when heated, closing cracks (Cardiff University)
- **Electrodeposition**: Electric current triggers mineral precipitation in cracks (Binghamton University)

**Current implementations**:
- **Belgium highway repairs** (2015): First field application of bacterial concrete in bridge repairs
- **Netherlands water infrastructure**: Canals and water treatment facilities using self-healing concrete
- **Singapore HDB**: Testing in public housing foundations

### Engineered Timber

Mass timber is the primary structural material of the Living City:

**Types**:
- **Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT)**: Layers glued perpendicular; structural panels
- **Glued Laminated Timber (Glulam)**: Parallel grain layers; beams and columns
- **Nail-Laminated Timber (NLT)**: Mechanically fastened; floors and roofs
- **Dowel-Laminated Timber (DLT)**: No adhesives; fully natural

**Performance vs. steel/concrete**:
| Property | Mass Timber | Steel | Concrete |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Strength-to-weight | Excellent | Good | Poor |
| Carbon impact | Negative (-1.1 tCO2/m³) | High (+2.0 tCO2/tonne) | High (+0.4 tCO2/tonne) |
| Fire resistance | Good (char layer protects) | Poor (loses strength at 550°C) | Good |
| Seismic performance | Excellent (ductile) | Good | Variable |
| Construction speed | 25% faster | Baseline | Slower |

**Landmark projects**:
- **Mjøstårnet** (Norway, 2019): 85.4m, world's tallest timber building
- **Ascent** (Milwaukee, 2022): 86.6m, tallest timber hybrid in North America
